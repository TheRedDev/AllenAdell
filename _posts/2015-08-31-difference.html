                                By limiting its number of client partnerships, Allen Adell does not encounter the conflicts and recruiting restrictions experienced by many firms. This strategy allows the company to develop in-depth relationships with its customers in order to understand their strategy, organizational capabilities, competencies and culture. By truly knowing its clients and utilizing a uniquely cultivated recruiting methodology, Allen Adell is able to achieve outstanding performance. Since 2003, the firm has completed 100% of its searches and over 71% of its business has come from either referred or repeat clients.

                                Unlike most big name firms, Allen Adell does not delegate search assignments to junior associates. You will be solving your management needs with a hands-on owner principal who shares your concerns and knows your business. Since 1989, the Managing Partner has been helping clients and candidates achieve their goals by building long-term relationships based on trust, professionalism, and results. The trust established with candidates is evident in the fact that many of these candidates eventually have become clients, and many clients have continued to use Allen Adell's services for years.
