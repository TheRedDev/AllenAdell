Most of our network has been built from referrals; people we have genuinely tried to help and their returning the favor. We have close relationships with an elite pool of passive candidates, the "A" players that are not looking. These superstars are not on the job boards and are happily employed. However, they have confidentially shared their career goals with us over the years, and we have the ability to make them aware of your opportunity as a potential advancement for their career. We also have the experience, knowledge, and skills necessary to actively recruit the top candidates from your direct competitors, assuming we do not already know them.
